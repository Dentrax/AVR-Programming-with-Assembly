## What It Is

**AVR Microcontroller Programming with Assembly**

AVR Microcontroller Programming with Assembly guide is an easy and advanced way to learn AVR programming.

**Required Tools**

* -**[AtmelStudio](http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelstudio.aspx)**
    - `Atmel Studio 7` is the integrated development platform (IDP) for developing and debugging Atmel® SMART ARM®-based and Atmel AVR® microcontroller (MCU)     applications. [only used for asm-level coding and debugging purpose]
* -**[ATmega2560 Microcontroller](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega2560)**
    - The high-performance, low-power `Atmel® AVR® 8-Bit RISC-based Microcontroller` [Used in this tutorial]
* -**[ATmega2560 Datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-2549-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega640-1280-1281-2560-2561_datasheet.pdf)**
    - Datasheet for `Atmel ATmega640/V-1280/V-1281/V-2560/V-2561/V`
 
## How To Use

Just research the **[main repository](https://github.com/Dentrax/AVR-Programming-with-Assembly)** and learn it gradually. Thats all.

## About

AVR-Programming-with-Assembly was created to serve three purposes:

**AVR-Programming-with-Assembly is a basically microprocessor programming learning repository coded in Assembly language using Atmel AVR**

1. To act as a guide to learn basic Assembly programming with enhanced and rich content.

2. To provide a simplest and easiest way to learn Atmel AVR programming. 

3. There is no any advanced Atmel AVR microprocessor programming guide coded in Assembly language on the internet.
